Backstory
---------
One of my friends is having a wedding, and my task is to prepare music and visual. My girlfriend came with an ideat to show a slideshow with pictures of them with random quotations about love (hence the original content of `slideshow.txt`). I couldn't find any multiplatform solution for this, so I made my own during weekend.
